# Ola-Dashboard
This project presents an end-to-end data analysis pipeline for Ola rides, built using SQL, Excel, Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Power BI.
The goal is to analyze ride trends, customer behavior, and revenue insights, and present them in an interactive Power BI dashboard for decision-making.

Features :  

Data Collection & Cleaning:

Raw ride data processed using Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Missing values handled, duplicates removed, and data transformed for analysis

Data Storage & Querying:

Structured tables created in SQL for easy querying

SQL queries used for customer trends, revenue generation, and trip analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted in Jupyter Notebook

Visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn

Statistical insights derived from customer & ride behavior

Excel Analysis:

Pivot tables, charts, and summary metrics

Used as an intermediate validation step before dashboard creation

Power BI Dashboard:

Interactive dashboard for business users

Key KPIs: Total Rides, Revenue, Avg. Trip Distance, Peak Booking Hours, Top Cities

Filters & slicers for dynamic exploration

Tech Stack

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

SQL: MySQL / PostgreSQL (for data queries & joins)

Excel: Pivot tables & visualization

Power BI: Dashboard creation & reporting

Jupyter Notebook: For EDA & workflow documentation
